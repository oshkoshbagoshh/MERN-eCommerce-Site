### Acceptance Cases
- Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Option to add, edit, view and delete all the items in our store.
- Option to add items or remove items from the cart.
- Display the total bill of the cart and update it as soon as the user updates the cart.
- Using Local Storage to store the JWT so that we only allow logged-in users to buy items.
