## Description
As a user, I would like an e-commerce website that is easy to use, and allows me to log-in, browse items, add items to my cart, and then checkout.

The site design should be minimal, but have strong functionality on the back-end for security (user authentification, etc.)

As a developer, I want to utilize the REST API to ensure CRUD operations are successfully routed from the backend to the frontend.



---
### Acceptance Cases
- Authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Option to add, edit, view and delete all the items in our store.
- Option to add items or remove items from the cart.
- Display the total bill of the cart and update it as soon as the user updates the cart.
- Using Local Storage to store the JWT so that we only allow logged-in users to buy items.
- Option to pay and checkout, thus creating an order and emptying the cart.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
